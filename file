## Scheduling System
This program generates a work schedule that takes into account for types of workers, 
worker availability, and allow for shift swapping between workers. This program also allows
customized scheduling for instance the desired amount of workers scheduled per hour. 

### User Story
A user can provide the amount of workers needed to be scheduled during the designated working 
hours to generate working schedules.
A user can check the availability of the worker and assign shifts accordingly.

### Design Patterns
Two Strategy patterns exists in the current implementation.
1. Scheduling Strategies
   This Strategy design pattern allows for extension for different types of scheduling. 
    For instance holiday hours that are more busy, and hence may require irregular working conditions.
- Regular Scheduling Strategy: To schedule under regular conditions. 
(normal working hours, static required amount of workers per hour.)
2. Printing Strategies
    This Strategy design pattern allows for extension for different types of schedule printing.
    For instance, print personalized schedule for workers, or generalized schedule for managers.
- Regular Printing Strategy: To print schedule under normal conditions.
  (regular prompts for shiftDetails and breaks.
